Uses an evolutionary algorithm to approximate a source image with triangles.
Generates a set of solutions, as vertices and colors of about 100 triangles.
Each step, it first kills the half that are the worst approximations.
More solutions are built by breeding old solutions.
Some vertices and colors are then mutated slightly.
